I will post blogs of whatever I feel like on this website. I think doing a movie review would be fun, or maybe I will just post pictures that I think are cool or interesting. Today I will post this Bob Ross painting that I like.

I like this painting because it is so simple, yet so detailed. Additionally, Bob Ross only took 1 hour to make a painting like this, he was a true master.

One pro of using the static website is that it is a great way to get information out to people in an easy to read way. A con for a static website is that it will do nothing else but display the html pages that have already been setup.

I have learned the difference between a static and dynamic webpage. This webpage that I have created is a static webpage, as all the information that is shown has been hard coded into the html. This webpage does not change until I change it. Additionally, I made this website very simple and easy to use like Apple's website. But my website is not nearly as good looking as Apple.com, because they hire many web developers and marketing gurus to make the best possible website that they can. I did make my website easy to use, because the only way to interact is to scroll down. There are no other buttons or navigation menus to go through.
