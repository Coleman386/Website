I will post blogs of whatever I feel like on this website. I think doing a movie review would be fun, or maybe I will just post pictures that I think are cool or interesting. Today I will post this Bob Ross painting that I like.

I like this painting because it is so simple, yet so detailed. Additionally, Bob Ross only took 1 hour to make a painting like this, he was a true master.

I have learned the difference between a static and dynamic webpage. This webpage that I have created is a static webpage, as all the information that is shown has been hard coded into the html. This webpage does not change until I change it. Additionally, I made this website very simple and easy to use like Apple's website. But my website is not nearly as good looking as Apple.com, because they hire many web developers and marketing gurus to make the best possible website that they can. I did make my website easy to use, because the only way to interact is to scroll down. There are no other buttons or navigation menus to go through.

  To understand how the important parts of a content management system have impacted the current state of content management, one must learn about the important parts first, and how they interact. The 3 main important parts of a content management system is the collection system, management system and publishing system.
	The collection system is the initial step in the content management system process. This is where the website manager or website creator uploads content into the content management system. An example of this would be a picture, like the Bob Ross painting I posted 3/11/2020, words like I am typing and you are reading right now, or even videos. Here is a brief example of how I uploaded that Bob Ross painting above to my content management system. First, I found the picture on the internet. I downloaded the picture to my personal computer. Then I uploaded the picture to the “assets” folder in my GitHub repository (which is basically a folder). Finally, to display the picture on my website all I had to do was reference the picture with a single line of code. Uploading text and videos follows a similar process. After the website manager or website creator uploads the content, the collection system has one more job which is to convert the picture, text or video into a format that the content management system is using. 
  The management system is the middle step, which I think is the most important step. This is the part where the content management system stores its information. Most of the time, the management system stores content as compressed content. Saving bandwidth is very important, not only to the website creator, but also to the website visitor. The website creator must pay for the data their website uses, and the website visitor must pay for the data to receive the content on the website. This is extremely important, and it is how websites like Netflix, YouTube and Disney+ are not bankrupt. If you were to watch a blue ray movie like Star Wars, the amount of data on that blue ray can be as much as 50Gb. So, if Disney+ streamed the entire blue ray to its millions of users each day, it would be racking up a massive data bill. Now imagine that the website visitor has a 10Gb data plan for their smartphone, the website visitor would only be able to watch 30mins of that movie to use up all their data for that month. Therefore, the collection system converts content for the management system to store, saving a lot of data. 
  Finally, the publishing system is the last step. This is the step where the website manager or website creator lays out the content in a meaningful way for its intended audience. This is the part that takes the most amount of human effort, since the publishing step is designed by humans for humans. If the website manager or creator designs their website poorly, website visitors will not enjoy their experience on the website, so they will leave or not visit as often. But if the website creator or website manager creates a good website that is easy to navigate, website visitors will visit more often and stick around. This is how the biggest websites of today are so popular, they are simple and easy to navigate compared to their competitors. Netflix, Google and Amazon all have super easy websites to navigate, which means people are more likely to visit and stick around. All three of those websites allow the user to search for anything they are looking for, and the websites will do their best to come up with results that match the users search. 
  Now that the important parts of the content management system have been explained, now I can explain how these parts have impacted the current state of content management. Today, most popular content management systems have been designed to make it as easy as possible for a website creator to upload content, store the content efficiently, and format it for you. I gave an example of how my content management system required 1 line of code and a repository, but most people don’t know how to code and they have no interest in coding. So, content management systems have evolved to make content management systems that are just drag and drop. So, if the website creator wanted to add that Bob Ross picture, all they must do is copy the link to the picture, give it to the website management system, and then drag and drop where they want that picture to be. The content management system automatically handles uploading the picture, converting it efficiently, and formatting the picture. This allows the website creator to focus on the design and navigation of the website, which is the most important part for retaining website visitors, instead of worrying about data usage, or formatting issues. Of course, for technically advanced people that know how to code, there are still plenty of content management systems out there that allow for customization of every part of the content management system.
