I will post blogs of whatever I feel like on this website. I think doing a movie review would be fun, or maybe I will just post pictures that I think are cool or interesting. Today I will post this Bob Ross painting that I like.

I like this painting because it is so simple, yet so detailed. Additionally, Bob Ross only took 1 hour to make a painting like this, he was a true master.

I have learned the difference between a static and dynamic webpage. This webpage that I have created is a static webpage, as all the information that is shown has been hard coded into the html. This webpage does not change until I change it. Additionally, I made this website very simple and easy to use like Apple's website. But my website is not nearly as good looking as Apple.com, because they hire many web developers and marketing gurus to make the best possible website that they can. I did make my website easy to use, because the only way to interact is to scroll down. There are no other buttons or navigation menus to go through.

To understand how the important parts of a content management system have impacted the current state of content management, one must learn about the important parts first, and how they interact. The 3 main important parts of a content management system is the collection system, management system and publishing system.
  
The collection system is the initial step in the content management system process. This is where the website manager or website creator uploads content into the content management system. An example of this would be a picture, like the Bob Ross painting I posted 3/11/2020, words like I am typing and you are reading right now, or even videos. Here is a brief example of how I uploaded that Bob Ross painting above to my content management system. First, I found the picture on the internet. I downloaded the picture to my personal computer. Then I uploaded the picture to the “assets” folder in my GitHub repository (which is basically a folder). Finally, to display the picture on my website all I had to do was reference the picture with a single line of code. Uploading text and videos follows a similar process. After the website manager or website creator uploads the content, the collection system has one more job which is to convert the picture, text or video into a format that the content management system is using. 
	
The management system is the middle step, which I think is the most important step. This is the part where the content management system stores its information. Most of the time, the management system stores content as compressed content. Saving bandwidth is very important, not only to the website creator, but also to the website visitor. The website creator must pay for the data their website uses, and the website visitor must pay for the data to receive the content on the website. This is extremely important, and it is how websites like Netflix, YouTube and Disney+ are not bankrupt. If you were to watch a blue ray movie like Star Wars, the amount of data on that blue ray can be as much as 50Gb. So, if Disney+ streamed the entire blue ray to its millions of users each day, it would be racking up a massive data bill. Now imagine that the website visitor has a 10Gb data plan for their smartphone, the website visitor would only be able to watch 30mins of that movie to use up all their data for that month. Therefore, the collection system converts content for the management system to store, saving a lot of data. 
  
Finally, the publishing system is the last step. This is the step where the website manager or website creator lays out the content in a meaningful way for its intended audience. This is the part that takes the most amount of human effort, since the publishing step is designed by humans for humans. If the website manager or creator designs their website poorly, website visitors will not enjoy their experience on the website, so they will leave or not visit as often. But if the website creator or website manager creates a good website that is easy to navigate, website visitors will visit more often and stick around. This is how the biggest websites of today are so popular, they are simple and easy to navigate compared to their competitors. Netflix, Google and Amazon all have super easy websites to navigate, which means people are more likely to visit and stick around. All three of those websites allow the user to search for anything they are looking for, and the websites will do their best to come up with results that match the users search. 
  
Now that the important parts of the content management system have been explained, now I can explain how these parts have impacted the current state of content management. Today, most popular content management systems have been designed to make it as easy as possible for a website creator to upload content, store the content efficiently, and format it for you. I gave an example of how my content management system required 1 line of code and a repository, but most people don’t know how to code and they have no interest in coding. So, content management systems have evolved to make content management systems that are just drag and drop. So, if the website creator wanted to add that Bob Ross picture, all they must do is copy the link to the picture, give it to the website management system, and then drag and drop where they want that picture to be. The content management system automatically handles uploading the picture, converting it efficiently, and formatting the picture. This allows the website creator to focus on the design and navigation of the website, which is the most important part for retaining website visitors, instead of worrying about data usage, or formatting issues. Of course, for technically advanced people that know how to code, there are still plenty of content management systems out there that allow for customization of every part of the content management system.

A CMS can support organizations very well, but it also has the potential to ruin an organization at the same time. A CMS system is like a double-edged sword. If you initially build the CMS well, and manage it over time, a CMS system can be very supportive. However if you rush the initial build of the CMS and neglect the maintenance over time, it can be the downfall of a company. For example, imagine a big website today. Lets consider Amazon.com. Amazon started as an online bookstore, then transitioned to one of the biggest retailers in the world, if not the biggest. If Amazon initially setup their CMS without the proper scalability and infrastructure upgrades, they wouldn’t have been able to scale from a tiny bookstore to international behemoth. Fortunately for them, their initial system was built in a way that allowed them to scale, and because of that design choice, they are extremely successful. 

There are many different teams within a CMS. Each team is very important, and it is crucial that each of those teams works together to form a CMS that works for the company. For instance, lets consider Amazon.com again. Amazon requires the best of the best in terms of software engineers, publishers and marketing. If any one of those teams is worse than the other, it can cause a bottleneck in the system. For example, if Amazon hired mediocre software engineers that built their codebase with limitations, Amazon.com might only be able to server 1,000 people per second. Additionally, they hired fantastic publishers and a great marketing team. The marketing team creates huge marketing campaigns that are widely successful, which brings in a ton of new shoppers to Amazon. The publishers create a great user interface that customers find easy to use, and it keeps customers shopping longer. At this point, they have too many customers for their codebase to handle, so the entire operation comes to a halt. Customers are unhappy even though the company got 66% of the CMS perfect. Or imagine that the codebase was built perfectly by the software engineers, allowing 1 million users per second. The publishers created the same perfect user interface, but then the marketing team completely ruins it by making a terrible advertising campaign. Now Amazon has the infrastructure to handle millions of users each day, but no one is interested in the website. This is why it is so important that each team interacts with each other to ensure an even distribution in talent, and capabilities for the website. 

The three main hurdles that stand in the way of any successful content management are the technology infrastructure of the website, the design of the website, and the marketing of the website. Each of these hurdles are extremely important for new website owners to watch out for. As I explained above, any one of those three hurdles can significantly hinder the success of a website. 

The technology infrastructure can be split into many different parts, including the database management, network infrastructure, object management and more. Each of these parts, are extremely important, and can be bottlenecked. Database management is essentially the part that stores all the data needed for the website. For Amazon, this would be the part that stores all the information about every product on their website. This would be any pictures, reviews, details, pricing, quantity and more. This information has to be stored and accessed from anywhere in the world, meaning this information cannot be stored all in one location, which leads into network infrastructure. Network infrastructure handles the internet traffic between the user and Amazon servers. This is the part that asks the user what they want, and delivers what they want extremely fast. In order to accomplish this task, every large online company uses multiple servers in different locations, so that data can be transferred a short distance, instead of travelling all from one central location. It has gotten to a point where the speed of light is too slow for most people, because the physical connections that make up the internet are not straight lines, but zig-zags that slow the connection down dramatically. Finally object management is important because it is what maintenance works with each day. Every time Amazon adds a new product or deletes an old project off their website, object management is what takes care of it. This is mostly done automatically now, as Amazon has 12 million unique products.

The design of the website can be broken up into many parts too. These parts include the navigation, readability, theme and more. The navigation of the website is the part where the user first visits the webpage and wants to navigate to the part of the website that they are interested in. For Amazon, the user can search all the product with the search bar or they can look through the different categories. The readability of the website is more about who is the website for. If the website is for the general population, like Amazon, it needs to be simple to use with just the right amount of information on the screen at a given time. If it is a website made for doctors, then maybe they can cram tons of information on the screen with medical vocab. The theme is what customers feel when they visit.  It makes them feel welcome and makes them want to stick around.

The Marketing of the website is also very important, but normally comes down to introducing new users to the website, or maintaining loyal users. Marketing is also in charge of events like sales for Amazon or business opportunities with other websites, like Amazon buying Whole Foods.

My authoring process is to just write how I feel. That part has not changed, as in my first post ever on my blog, I wrote, “I will post blogs of whatever I feel like on this website”. I have stuck to my roots, probably because it has only been 2 months since that post. 

My collection, management and publishing system are very basic. For collection, I just manually type out a post, and add pictures if needed. For management, I just edit the post if I find something that needs changed. For publishing, I use a pre-built formatter that themes my posts for me. However, this is exactly what I wanted. An easy to use and maintain website that took minimal time investment. This is why people use website makers online like WordPress and SquareSpace.

The biggest takeaways I have learned from this class is to start the website off with a good backend foundation. In other words, if you plan on making a website that millions of users are going to use, make sure your backend can support that many users. On the flip side, if only a few users are going to use your website, a perfect backend isn’t required, just get something simple put up. 

My website’s main weakness I think is the lack of a search bar or any type of organization. When I built my website, I thought I would be making short posts every week, so the amount of content wouldn’t get out of control. However, there were a few weeks where I posted a very long post (including this one). This has led to my website requiring a lot of scrolling to get from post to post. I didn’t account for this initially, and it is a terrible user experience.
