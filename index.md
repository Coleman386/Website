I will post blogs of whatever I feel like on this website. I think doing a movie review would be fun, or maybe I will just post pictures that I think are cool or interesting. Today I will post this Bob Ross painting that I like.

I like this painting because it is so simple, yet so detailed. Additionally, Bob Ross only took 1 hour to make a painting like this, he was a true master.
